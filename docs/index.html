        As an induction styled play common to Shakespearean literature, the main play of The taming of the shrew is enacted out for the benefit of the introductory character Christopher Sly. Sly is a drunkard who is tricked by a nobleman into believing he descends form nobility. </p>   
    <p class="information">The ensuing play then unfolds with the comical story of Petruchio of Verona and his courtship and marriage to Katherina. The eldest of two sisters, Katrina is a head strong ill mannered shrew. The comedy depicts Petruchioâ€™s witty but psychological treatment of Katrina in a bid to temper her obstinate behavior. He succeeds by subduing Katharina who ultimately falls in love with her husband and becomes the obedient wife.
