			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exit a Servingman</h2>
			<p class="verseline">I know the boy will well usurp the grace,<br />Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman;<br />I long to hear him call the drunkard ‘husband’;<br />And how my men will stay themselves from laughter<br />When they do homage to this simple peasant.<br />I’ll in to counsel them; haply my presence<br />May well abate the over-merry spleen,<br />Which otherwise would grow into extremes. </p>

Ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet- nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.</p>

Hark! Apollo plays, <span class="stage_directions_inline">[Music]</span><br />And twenty caged nightingales do sing.<br />Or wilt thou sleep? We’ll have thee to a couch<br />Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed<br />On purpose trimm’d up for Semiramis.<br />Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground.<br />Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp’d,<br />Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.<br />Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar<br />Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?<br />Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them<br />And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.</p>

			<p class="verseline">Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight<br />Adonis painted by a running brook,<br />And Cytherea all in sedges hid,<br />Which seem to move and wanton with her breath<br />Even as the waving sedges play wi’ th’ wind.</p>
			<p class="character">Lord</p>

			<p class="character">Sly</p>
			<p class="verseline">These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.<br />But did I never speak of all that time?</p>
			<p class="character">First Servant</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;<br />For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,<br />Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;<br />And rail upon the hostess of the house,<br />And say you would present her at the leet,<br />Because she brought stone jugs and no seal’d quarts.<br />Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.</p>
			<p class="character">Sly</p>

			<p class="verseline">Nay, then ‘tis time to stir him from his trance.<br />I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,<br />Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her.

			<p class="prose">I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O’ my word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so. Why, that’s nothing; and he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope-tricks. I’ll tell you what, sir: an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
